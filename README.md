# PhishShield---Chrome-Extension
PhishShield is a lightweight Chrome extension that protects users from phishing, malware, and suspicious websites by automatically scanning visited URLs using the VirusTotal API.  Every time you load a website, PhishShield quietly checks the link in the background and alerts you immediately if itâ€™s dangerous. No clicks required.
